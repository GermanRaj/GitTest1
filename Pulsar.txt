A pulsar (from pulsating radio source)[1][2] 
is a highly magnetized rotating neutron star that emits beams of electromagnetic radiation out of its magnetic poles.
This radiation can be observed only when a beam of emission is pointing toward Earth
(similar to the way a lighthouse can be seen only when the light is pointed in the direction of an observer),
and is responsible for the pulsed appearance of emission.
Neutron stars are very dense and have short,
regular rotational periods.
This produces a very precise interval between pulses that ranges from milliseconds to seconds for an individual pulsar.
Pulsars are one of the candidates for the source of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays.
